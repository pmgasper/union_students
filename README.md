# union_students
These notebooks contain my code and results for an ongoing consultation project with Union College. The data consist of letter
grade by course matched with student information (i.e. class year) for mathematics majors who graduated between the 13-14 and 17-18
academic years. The aim is to automate data visualization and identify potentially interesting trends, with a particular interest
in identifying insights that might suggest improvements to the student experience.

The project is divided into a series of Juypter notebooks:
1. [Project Overview](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/pmgasper/union_students/blob/master/nb01_overview.ipynb)
2. [Data Cleaning](nb02_cleaning.ipynb)
3. [Descriptive Statistics](nb03_descriptive_stats.ipynb)
4. [Inferential Statistics](nb04_hypothesis_testing.ipynb)
5. [Geographic Maps - Data Cleaning](nb05a_map_data.ipynb)<br>
   [Geographic Maps - Display](nb05b_map_display.ipynb)

Additional files:
* [Constants](union_constants.py) used throughout project 
* Raw data is stored locally
